- Gather qualitative feedback on the user-friendliness of the Partner Onboarding and Sanad Hub Task Submission flows.
- Validate that the AI-powered document analysis (CR and ID cards) is accurate and provides real value.
- Test the platform's performance and stability with the first cohort of real users.

### 2. Target Beta Testers
