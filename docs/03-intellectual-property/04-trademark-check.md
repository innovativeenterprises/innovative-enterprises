| 2024-08-01 | Oman MOCIIP Portal (Business Gateway)                                | N                        | None found in relevant classes (Class 35: Business Services, Class 42: SaaS). | Clear for use in Oman.              |
| 2024-08-01 | WIPO Global Brand Database                                         | N                        | A few "Sanad" marks exist in other countries for unrelated services (insurance, healthcare). | Low risk of confusion in our target GCC market for tech services. "Sanad Hub" is unique. |

| Date       | Search Tool Used (e.g., Google Images, USPTO Design Search) | Similar Logos Found? | Notes / Assessment |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :----------------- |
| 2024-08-01 | Google Reverse Image Search                                 | Numerous shield logos exist, as it's a common design element. | Our specific combination of the shield shape, color, and typography appears to be unique. No direct matches found. |

### 3. Assessment & Recommendation

**Recommendation:** Proceed with trademark application in Oman and key GCC markets under Class 35 (Business Services) and Class 42 (Software as a Service). The name "Sanad Hub" and its associated shield logo appear to be available and defensible. The term "Sanad" is common in Arabic, but its combination with "Hub" for this specific digital service creates a distinctive mark.
