### 2. Invention Disclosure Draft

#### 2.1. Title of Invention
A System and Method for AI-Driven Analysis and Delegation of Service Tasks in a Digital Marketplace.

#### 2.2. Abstract
A system comprising a user interface for submitting a service task, a first AI agent (`analyzeSanadTask`) for analyzing the task to determine a set of required documents and prerequisites, and a second AI agent for routing the task and its requirements to a network of registered service providers. The system receives bids from providers and presents them to the user for selection, thereby creating an efficient, transparent, and automated digital marketplace for complex services.

#### 2.3. Background of the Invention
Conventional methods for outsourcing administrative or government-related tasks are inefficient. A user must manually identify a service provider (e.g., a Sanad office), contact them, and then be informed of the required documents, often leading to multiple trips and delays. Existing digital marketplaces simply connect users and providers but do not assist in preparing the task requirements beforehand, leading to friction and failed transactions. This invention solves this by using a preliminary AI analysis step to ensure the user is fully prepared before engaging with a provider.

#### 2.4. Detailed Description of the Invention
The system operates as follows:
1. A user selects a service (e.g., "Renew Commercial Registration") from a predefined list on a user interface.
2. The selection is sent to a first AI agent (`analyzeSanadTask`). This agent, trained on government regulations, returns a checklist of required documents (e.g., "Copy of CR", "Owner's Passport Copy").
3. The user is prompted to upload these specific documents.
4. Once the documents are provided, the entire task package (service request + documents) is routed to a network of qualified service providers (e.g., Sanad offices registered on the "Sanad Hub").
5. The providers review the complete task package and submit competitive bids.
6. The user receives and compares the bids and selects a provider to complete the task.

#### 2.5. Claims
*This is the most critical part for a patent lawyer. Define the specific, novel, and non-obvious elements of your invention that you claim as your own.*
- **Claim 1:** A method for service task delegation, comprising: receiving a service request from a user; invoking a first artificial intelligence agent to analyze said request and generate a list of prerequisite documents; receiving said documents from the user; and transmitting the service request and the received documents to a plurality of service providers.
- **Claim 2:** The method of Claim 1, further comprising: receiving a plurality of bids from said service providers; and presenting said bids to the user for selection.
