**Usage Guidelines:**
- Use the primary, full-text logo whenever possible, especially in headers.
- The Icon can be used for favicons, social media profile pictures, and in-app elements where space is limited.
- Do not stretch, distort, or change the colors of the logo.
- Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "I" in "INNOVATIVE".

### 4. Tone of Voice
*How should the brand sound? Describe the personality.*

- **Professional & Knowledgeable:** We are experts in technology and the Omani business landscape. Our language is clear, confident, and precise.
- **Innovative & Empowering:** We are forward-thinking problem solvers. We don't just offer tools; we offer solutions that empower our clients.
- **Trustworthy & Reliable:** We are a dependable partner. Our tone is reassuring, secure, and straightforward.
- **Approachable & Helpful:** We are not an intimidating, faceless corporation. We are an Omani SME here to help other SMEs succeed. Our AI agents have friendly personas (Aida, Voxi, etc.).

**Example "Do" and "Don't":**
- **Do:** "Accelerate your business operations by delegating tasks to our verified network of service providers through the Sanad Hub."
- **Don't:** "Use our cool app to get stuff done faster by other people."

### 5. Imagery & Iconography
*Describe the style of photos and icons to be used.*
- **Photography:** Use professional, high-quality photos that are authentic and feature a diverse group of people in modern Omani business settings. Blend images of technology with Omani culture. Avoid generic, "corporate-speak" stock photos.
- **Iconography:** Use the `lucide-react` icon library. Icons should be clean, line-based, and consistently implemented across the platform. For custom icons (e.g., Sanad Hub), maintain a similar line weight and style.
