## 5. Identified Gaps & Blue Oceans
*What areas are underserved? Where is there a "blue ocean" with little to no competition?*

- **The Integrated Ecosystem:** While individual solutions (a freelance site, a single AI tool) exist, there is no integrated platform that combines a services marketplace, AI automation, and partner management tools specifically for the Omani market. This synergy is our blue ocean.
- **Digitalization of Sanad Services:** There is a major untapped opportunity to create a digital bridge between clients and the hundreds of physical Sanad Service Centres, which currently operate in a fragmented, offline manner.
