innovative-enterprises ("us", "we", or "our") operates the `innovativeenterprises.tech` website and its associated services (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

### 1. Information Collection and Use
We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

- **Personal Data:** While using our Service, such as during partner onboarding, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, and company details ("Personal Data").
- **Usage Data:** We may also collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This may include your computer's IP address, browser type, pages visited, and other diagnostic data.
- **Uploaded Documents:** When you use our AI tools (e.g., Voxi Translator, CR Analysis), you may upload documents. These documents are processed to provide the requested service.

### 2. Use of Data
innovative-enterprises uses the collected data for various purposes:
- To provide and maintain the Service (e.g., to connect you with service providers).
- To process your documents with our AI agents to generate the outputs you request.
- To notify you about changes to our Service.
- To provide customer care and support.
- To improve the Service and monitor its usage.

### 3. Data Storage and Security
- **Your privacy is our priority.** The content of documents you upload for AI analysis is **not** stored permanently on our servers after the analysis is complete. We process the document in-memory to perform the task and then discard it.
- The security of your data is important to us. We use commercially acceptable means (including encryption and secure cloud infrastructure provided by Firebase) to protect your Personal Data, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

### 4. Service Providers and AI Models
We use third-party companies and services to facilitate our Service.
- **Google AI:** We use Google's generative AI models (Gemini) to provide the AI feature. Per Google's terms, this data is not used to train their global models.
- **Firebase:** We use Firebase for hosting, database, and authentication services.

### 5. Your Rights
You have the right to access, update, or delete the information we have on you. You can do this through your account settings (E-Briefcase) or by contacting us directly.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
