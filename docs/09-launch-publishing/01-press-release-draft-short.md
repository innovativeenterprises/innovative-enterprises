Founded by CEO Jumaa Salim Al Hadidi and CTO Anwar Ahmed Sharif, the company leverages a "digital workforce" of over 20 AI agents to design, develop, and manage a portfolio of more than 30 technology products. This model enables rapid innovation in sectors like government services, e-commerce, and career development.
