### Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue: User reports that the "Sign in with Google" button is not working.**
- **Possible Cause 1:** Pop-up blocker is enabled on the user's browser.
  - **Solution:** Ask the user to disable their pop-up blocker for our site.
- **Possible Cause 2:** Third-party cookies are disabled.
  - **Solution:** Guide the user to enable third-party cookies in their browser settings.
- **Escalation:** If the issue persists, ask for a screenshot of the browser console and escalate to the development team.

**Issue: An AI feature is taking too long to return a result or times out.**
- **Possible Cause 1:** The AI model provider (Google) is experiencing high traffic.
  - **Solution:** Advise the user to wait a few minutes and try again.
- **Possible Cause 2:** The user's input is very large or complex (e.g., a 100-page document).
  - **Solution:** Suggest they try with a smaller document to confirm the feature is working, and inform them that larger inputs will naturally take more time.
- **Escalation:** If the issue is persistent across all inputs, report it to the development team to check the status of our backend services.
