### Common Customer Questions

**Q: Is my data safe when I upload a document for AI analysis?**
**A:** Yes. We prioritize your privacy and security. Documents you upload for analysis are processed in-memory and are **not** stored on our servers after the task is complete. We use Google's secure AI platform, which does not use your data to train their global models. Please see our Privacy Policy for more details.

**Q: What happens when I submit a task to the Sanad Hub?**
**A:** When you submit a task, it is anonymously and securely broadcast to all relevant and verified Sanad Service Centres in our network. Those offices will then review your request and submit competitive bids for your work. You will be notified as bids arrive and can choose the best offer for you.

**Q: I am a freelancer. How do I get paid?**
**A:** For tasks and projects facilitated through our platform, we act as the intermediary. The client pays us upon accepting your proposal, and we hold the funds in escrow. The funds are released to you upon successful completion and approval of the work by the client, less our standard platform service fee.

**Q: The AI made a mistake extracting my CR information. What do I do?**
**A:** While our AI is highly accurate, mistakes can occasionally happen. The form is fully editable. Please simply correct any errors in the form fields before you submit your application.

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue: User reports that the AI document analysis is failing or timing out.**
- **Possible Cause 1:** The uploaded document is a very low-quality scan or has complex, unsupported formatting.
  - **Solution:** Ask the user to try uploading a clearer, higher-resolution version of the document if possible.
- **Possible Cause 2:** The document is password-protected.
  - **Solution:** Ask the user to remove the password protection and re-upload.
- **Possible Cause 3:** Temporary high traffic on the Google AI API.
  - **Solution:** Advise the user to wait a few minutes and try the analysis again.
- **Escalation:** If the issue persists with a good-quality document, ask for a copy of the document (with user permission) and escalate to the development team to test the AI flow.

**Issue: A partner says they are not receiving any task notifications.**
- **Possible Cause 1:** Their profile is incomplete or key services are not listed.
  - **Solution:** Guide the partner to their E-Briefcase to ensure their profile is fully filled out and that they have registered for the service categories they want to receive tasks for.
- **Possible Cause 2:** Their notification settings are turned off.
  - **Solution:** Advise them to check their account settings to ensure email or WhatsApp notifications are enabled.
- **Escalation:** If the profile is complete and settings are correct, check the admin dashboard to ensure the partner is marked as 'Vetted' and 'Active'. If so, escalate to the development team to check the task routing logic.
