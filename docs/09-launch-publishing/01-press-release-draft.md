**Muscat, Oman – [Date]** – Innovative Enterprises, a pioneering Omani SME in the technology sector, today announced the launch of its comprehensive, AI-powered business services platform. The platform is designed to automate critical operations, streamline service delegation, and foster growth for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across the Sultanate, in direct alignment with Oman Vision 2040.

The new platform integrates several key services, including the **Sanad Hub**, a digital marketplace connecting clients with a network of verified Sanad Service Centres, and the **Business Hub**, a B2B network for freelancers and companies. At its core is a suite of AI agents—including **Voxi**, a high-fidelity document translator, and **Aida**, a legal and administrative assistant—designed to automate complex tasks.

"By combining a services marketplace with a powerful AI workforce, we are providing businesses with the tools to not only become more efficient but also to compete on a larger scale. This is digital transformation made practical and accessible."

Key features of the platform available at launch include:
- **AI-Assisted Onboarding:** New partners can register in minutes by uploading their CR or ID, with our AI automatically extracting and filling in the required information.
- **E-Briefcase:** A secure digital vault for partners to manage their legal documents, service agreements, and company profile.
- **Sanad Hub:** A transparent and efficient way to delegate government-related tasks and receive competitive quotes from multiple service providers.
