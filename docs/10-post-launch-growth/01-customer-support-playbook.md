### Guiding Principles
1.  **Be Empathetic:** Acknowledge the user's frustration first.
2.  **Be Clear & Concise:** Avoid technical jargon. Provide simple, step-by-step instructions.
3.  **Be Responsive:** Aim for a first-response time of under 1 hour during business hours.
4.  **Own the Problem:** Even if it's not our fault, take responsibility for finding a solution for the user.

### Canned Responses / Templates

#### **Issue: User can't log in.**
**Response:**
"Hi [User Name], I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble logging in. Could you please try resetting your password using the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page? If you've already tried that, please let me know the email address you used to sign up, and I'll investigate further."

#### **Issue: User is reporting a bug.**
**Response:**
"Thank you so much for reporting this! I've been able to reproduce the issue on our end. I've logged it with our development team, and they will be looking into it with high priority. We'll let you know as soon as a fix is released. We appreciate you helping us improve the product!"

#### **Issue: User is requesting a feature.**
**Response:**
"That's an excellent suggestion! I can definitely see how [the requested feature] would be useful. I've passed your feedback directly to our product team for consideration in our future roadmap. We really value input from our users, so thank you for sharing!"

#### **Issue: User is unhappy and threatening to cancel.**
**Response:**
"I'm very sorry to hear that you're not satisfied with your experience. Our goal is to provide a valuable service, and it sounds like we've fallen short. I'd love to understand your specific concerns better to see if we can make things right. Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call this week?"

### Escalation Path
- **Tier 1 (First Response):** [Support Agent Name]
  - **Responsibilities:** Handle common questions, troubleshoot basic issues, use canned responses.
- **Tier 2 (Technical Issues):** [Lead Developer Name]
  - **When to Escalate:** When a bug is confirmed, when there's a system outage, or when a user has a technical issue that Tier 1 cannot solve.
- **Tier 3 (Billing/Account Issues):** [Project Manager/CEO Name]
  - **When to Escalate:** For refund requests, major subscription issues, or complaints about company policy.
