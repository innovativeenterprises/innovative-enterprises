# Customer Support Playbook

---

### Guiding Principles
1.  **Be Empathetic & Patient:** Our users are busy SME owners and freelancers. Acknowledge their frustration first, then solve their problem.
2.  **Be Clear & Concise:** Avoid technical jargon. Provide simple, step-by-step instructions. Use screenshots or short videos if necessary.
3.  **Be Responsive:** Aim for a first-response time of under 2 hours for emails during business hours. Use Aida (AI Chat) for instant Tier 0 support.
4.  **Own the Problem:** Even if it's a user error, our goal is to get them to a solution. Take responsibility for guiding them through it.

### Canned Responses / Templates

#### **Issue: User's CR/ID analysis failed.**
**Response:**
"Hi [User Name], I'm sorry you're having trouble with the document analysis. This can sometimes happen if the uploaded scan is blurry or has a lot of glare. Could you please try uploading a clear, high-resolution picture of the document? If the problem continues, please send the file to `support@innovativeenterprises.tech` and I will ask our technical team to investigate."

#### **Issue: A Sanad Partner is complaining about not getting leads.**
**Response:**
"Hi [Partner Name], thank you for reaching out. To ensure you receive all relevant task notifications, could you please double-check that your profile is fully complete and that you have registered for all the service categories you wish to provide? A complete profile is much more likely to be selected by clients. Here is a link to your profile settings: [Link]. Let me know if you need any help!"

#### **Issue: User is asking for a feature we don't have yet.**
**Response:**
"That's an excellent suggestion for [the requested feature]! I can definitely see how that would be a valuable addition to the platform. Our product team actively reviews all user feedback, and I've passed yours directly to them for consideration in our upcoming roadmap. We really value your input in helping us build a better platform!"

#### **Issue: A client is unhappy with a service provider from the Hub.**
**Response:**
