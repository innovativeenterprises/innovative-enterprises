 * @fileOverview A simple global state management store for the prototype.
 *
 * This avoids the need for a full state management library like Redux or Zustand
 * for this prototype application. It uses a simple listener pattern to update
 * components when the state changes.
 *
 * This file is NOT part of the user's visible code but is a necessary
 * architectural piece to make the prototype function correctly across pages.
