# Transforming Services into Standalone Apps

Yes, it is absolutely possible to transform any of the built-in services (like "Sanad Hub" or "Nova Commerce") into a separate, standalone application while maintaining data and logical integrity with the other services.

The current architecture is designed to be modular, which makes this process feasible. Here’s how you would do it:

### 1. Separate the Frontend Application

You would create a new, separate Next.js project for the service you want to spin off (e.g., "Sanad Hub").

-   **Copy UI Components**: Move all the relevant frontend files for that service—such as the pages in `/app/sanad-hub/`, its specific forms, and any related UI components—into the new project.
-   **Independent Deployment**: This new application would be deployed independently and could have its own domain name (e.g., `sanad-hub.INNOVATIVE ENTERPRISES.om`).

### 2. Maintain Integrity with a Shared Backend

The key to keeping the services connected is to share the backend resources rather than creating new ones.

-   **Shared Database**: Both the main application and the new standalone app would connect to the **same central database** (e.g., Google Firestore). This ensures that any data created or updated in one application (like a new user registration or a submitted task) is immediately available and consistent in the other.
-   **Shared Authentication**: You would use a centralized authentication provider (like Firebase Authentication). This allows for a Single Sign-On (SSO) experience. A user who creates an account on the main platform can use the same credentials to log in to the new standalone app, and their user profile will be consistent across both.
-   **Centralized AI Flows & APIs**: The AI flows we have built (like `analyzeSanadTask` or `generateAgreement`) can be deployed as a single set of cloud functions or microservices. Both the main platform and any standalone apps would make API calls to this central "brain." This ensures that all business logic is consistent and maintained in one place, preventing any discrepancies in how tasks are processed.

By separating the frontend presentation layer while sharing the backend data, authentication, and logic layers, you can create distinct, standalone applications for each service that still work together seamlessly as part of a single, integrated platform.
